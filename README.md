**Object Detection with OpenCV and YOLOv4**

Welcome to the Object Detection project repository! This project showcases a robust and efficient Object Detection system built using OpenCV and YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4). Harnessing the power of computer vision and deep learning, our system can accurately detect and localize objects in images and videos.

**Features:**

- State-of-the-art object detection powered by the YOLOv4 model, known for its real-time and high-precision performance.
- Seamless integration of OpenCV's DNN module for efficient deep neural network inference.
- Configurable confidence threshold and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) threshold for fine-tuning detection sensitivity and precision.
- Visualization of object detection results with green bounding boxes, making it easy to identify detected objects.
- Supports both image and video processing for real-world applications in various domains.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download the YOLOv4 model files (`yolov4.weights` and `yolov4.cfg`) from reputable sources.
3. Place the model files in the `dnn_model` directory of the project.
4. Install the required dependencies (OpenCV and NumPy).
5. Run the `main.py` script to perform object detection on your images or videos.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.9 or later
- OpenCV (with DNN support)
- NumPy

**Usage:**

Our Object Detection system offers a simple yet powerful interface for detecting objects in your images and videos. Whether you're interested in security applications, autonomous vehicles, or custom object detection tasks, our system is designed to adapt to diverse use cases.
